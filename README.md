This is a current project as of 10/13/2024. This is an application to control addressable LED lights through an Arduino/ESP32/or any other alternative. It can control those lights with a simple GUI and even sync live music from an output. None of this is implemented in any way and probably won't be until a full 1.0 release a second publish to the main will be made once I am happy with the current app but for now, it will be on the alpha branch, and may move to others when more features are implemented.
